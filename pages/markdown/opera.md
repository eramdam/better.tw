title: "Installing Better TweetDeck on Opera"
---

Better TweetDeck **was** available on https://addons.opera.com, but the Opera add-ons team's review times have been very complicated to deal with, so the Opera version always was days if not weeks late compared to the Chrome/Firefox one.

Fortunately, there's a "better" way. It's a workaround, it's not ideal, but at least you'll get updates at the same time as Chrome and Firefox users!

Follow those steps:

- Open Opera
- Install the ["Install Chrome Extensions"](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/?display=en) add-on
- Go find [Better TweetDeck on the Chrome Web Store](https://better.tw/chrome)
- Install Better TweetDeck by clicking "Add to Chrome"
- Confirm the install when Opera asks you to
- You're all set! Enjoy ðŸŽŠ
