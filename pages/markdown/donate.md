title: 'Donate to Better TweetDeck'
---

Better TweetDeck is and always will be free, without any ads. But that doesn't mean it's free to develop!

If you appreciate Better TweetDeck despite the bugs that happen every so often, I would appreciate if you could donate a few bucks üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<br/>

**However**, If you're living in the United States, I'd rather have you donate to one of those charities instead. The people they support will need the money more than I do:

- [Center for Reproductive rights](https://secure3.convio.net/cfrr/site/Donation2;jsessionid=97A4C7A9488B5DDF3450546DE1123DB2.app347a?1380.donation=form1&df_id=1380&web&_ga=1.145398384.513337705.1476995534)
- [Lambda Legal](https://www.lambdalegal.org/donate)
- [Planned Parenthood](https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Donation2?df_id=12913&12913.donation=form1&_ga=1.38484843.997121566.1477408976)
- [And many more](https://jezebel.com/a-list-of-pro-women-pro-immigrant-pro-earth-anti-big-1788752078)
