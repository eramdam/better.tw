title: 'Donate to Better TweetDeck'

Better TweetDeck is and always will be free, without any ads. But that doesn't mean it's free to develop! If you consider what Better TweetDeck valuable, feel free to donate to support its development! I'd be always grateful for that üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<br/><br/>

**However**, If you're living in the United States, I'd rather have you donate to one of those charities instead. The people they support will need the money more than I do:

- [Center for Reproductive rights](https://secure3.convio.net/cfrr/site/Donation2;jsessionid=97A4C7A9488B5DDF3450546DE1123DB2.app347a?1380.donation=form1&df_id=1380&web&_ga=1.145398384.513337705.1476995534)
- [Lambda Lega](https://www.lambdalegal.org/donate)
- [Planned Parenthood](https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Donation2?df_id=12913&12913.donation=form1&_ga=1.38484843.997121566.1477408976)
- [ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu?ms=web_horiz_nav_hp)
- [And many more](https://jezebel.com/a-list-of-pro-women-pro-immigrant-pro-earth-anti-big-1788752078)
