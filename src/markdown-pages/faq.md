## What's this?

Better TweetDeck is a browser extension created back in 2014 made to improve, customize and extend the features set of [TweetDeck][TD], the official Twitter client.

## Are you working with or affiliated with Twitter?

<u>__*No.*__</u> I know the name is confusing because the extension is literally named "Better **TweetDeck**" but no, the extension is nor made by nor affiliated with Twitter and the TweetDeck team.

## Will Better TweetDeck stay free?

Yes. Better TweetDeck is and always will be free and [open-source][github].

## Can you implement [feature]?

Maybe! Feel free to open a [Github issue][github-issues] by following the [contributing guidelines][contributing]

## Can you revert that last thing that TweetDeck did?

It Depends‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. If the thing is easily fixable then it's likely that I'll add an option to revert it. If it's not, it'll really depends on whether or not I can find an easy solution that won't be a nightmare to maintain long-term.

## Something is broken! Please fix it already!

Bugs happen, and reports are appreciated, feel free to open a [Github issue][github-issues]. Please understand that TweetDeck is constantly being updated and is a very complex app so features breaking are the norm, not the exception.

## Will there ever be a desktop app?

I don't want to say never, but it's unlikely. Maintaining a browser extension alredy takes a lot of time. Besides, I feel like Twitter might start to be annoyed if I distribute an application who's named after one of their products üò¨

## Can you make a mobile app?

No. I already don't have time for a desktop app, so you can imagine how little time I have to learn mobile development and build a mobile app üôÉ

## I love Better TweetDeck! How can I support it?

I'm glad to hear that! Feel free to hit the [donate](/donate) page for more informations about that.
